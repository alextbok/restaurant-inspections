Data Science Final Project

NOTE: I've deployed the application and it can be found at:
	http://ec2-52-5-9-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

Most information about the project is in the writeup. It can be accessed by running the Flask server in app/
To run the Flask server, simply navigate to the app/ folder and type: "python runserver.py --development"
To access the writeup, open a browser and hit the endpoint localhost:5000/writeup or http://ec2-52-5-9-230.compute-1.amazonaws.com/writeup
Additionally, comments in the code describe the internals. This README is to give a general overview of organization and package structure.

./analysis
	./analysis/queries
		Contains the queries run for analysis
		Queries can be run like so:
			sqlite3 ../../app/data/inspections.db < query1.sql
		A summary of the results is described in the writeup (mentioned above)
	./analysis/results
		A few text files where I output some of the queries (for the rest of them I simply looked at standard output)
		These aren't very relevant and some of them may be the output of deprecated queries

./processing.py
	A small python script I used to run some basic queries on the data (to see if it interested me)
	It simply slurps up the csv files and has functionality to query on violation code
	This shouldn't be relevant to grading

./geocoding
	Contains all relevant code used to geocode the addresses (mainly python scripts)
	It's pretty messy, because the geocoding process itself was quite messy

./app
	Root folder of the Flask application
	./app/data
		Contains the csv files used to create the database/serve to the client
		These files are used in ./app/application/db and ./app/application/util
	./app/application
		Contains all relevant code run by the server and all static files (e.g. markup and javascript)
		./app/application/views.py
			Contains server context and routes
		./app/application/db
			Package that creates and interacts with the database
		./app/application/util
			Package the handles caching and a few post processing functions used once the data is retrieved
		./app/application/templates
			Contains the html files
		./app/application/static
			Contains markup, javascript, and pngs
